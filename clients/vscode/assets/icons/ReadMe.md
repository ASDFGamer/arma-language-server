This is existing in case that at any point in time, vscode decides to add proper file-type icon support.

(As of now)[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/14662] that sadly involves either creating a Pull Request in the hopes that it will eventually be merged into the most-used iconset or
cloning that icon-set, providing your own (just for the sake of having a single icon added i want to mention here)

obviously, both ways are a horrifying way and vscode is at fault here.

Anyways ... in case they ever decide to un**** this situation, in here lay the files required for it.
