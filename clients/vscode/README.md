    * Syntax Checking
* Code Analysis
    * Unused variable warning
    * Unused value warning
* Syntax Highlighting
* Reference (Symbol) lookup
* Disable reported problems and informations *Note that disabling syntactical errors will not fix the file*


# Planned Features
* Basic Auto Completion (Macros, Variables, Operators, ...)
* Extended Auto Completion (Read params of methods and automagically complete on call, ...)
* Debugger (SQF-VM powered)
* Resolve macro on hover
* PreProcess file and display it

# FAQ
## Enable/Disable a problem
Note: `ERROR-CODE` in the following samples is the code reported by the language server (eg. `VV-001`)

To disable a warning for the line following, use
`#pragma sls disable line ERROR-CODE`
This will surpress the error code for the next line.
To disable (and later enable) an error code on a long span, use
```sqf
#pragma sls disable ERROR-CODE
// [...]
#pragma sls enable ERROR-CODE
```

## Scripted analyzers
The language server supports scripted analyzers.
A scripted analyzer is a script that is called by the language server on every file,
allowing you to implement your own analyzers in SQF.

To enable scripted analyzers, you have to create an empty file called `use_scripted_analyzers`
at `<workspace>/.vscode/sqfvm-lsp/use_scripted_analyzers` (where `<workspace>` is the workspace root).

After touching any other file managed by the language server, the language server will
automatically generate template files for the scripted analyzers, including a documentation
on how to use them.

## Exclude files (or folders) from analysis
Every workspace will have a file available at `<workspace>/.vscode/sqfvm-lsp/ls-ignore.txt` allowing to exclude files (and folders) from analysis.
The file will be auto-generated if it is not existing.
Further details are available in that file.
