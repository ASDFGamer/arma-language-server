# Welcome to scripted analyzers

This is a short introduction to scripted analyzers.
It will cover the basics of how to write your own analyzer and how to use it.

# What are scripted analyzers?

Scripted analyzers are a way to extend the functionality of the language server
by writing your own analyzers in SQF. This allows you to write e.g. your own
diagnostics. The analyzers are run on the server and the results are sent to
the client, which will display them in the editor.

# Data structures, types and enums

The following are the data structures, types and enums that are available to the analyzers.
They will be referred in the documentation by writing `<type>` where type is
the name of the data structure.

## Enum: `SEVERITY`

```sqf
// One of the following:
"FATAL";
"ERROR";
"WARNING";
"INFO";
"VERBOSE";
"TRACE";
```

The severity of a diagnostic. The higher the severity, the more important the
diagnostic is.
FATAL is the highest severity and TRACE is the lowest.

| Severity | Description                                                                                                                       | Problems | Editor |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|
| FATAL    | The highest severity, should be used sparingly.                                                                                   | ERROR    | RED    |
| ERROR    | The second-highest severity, should be used for problems that prevent the code from running.                                      | ERROR    | RED    |
| WARNING  | The third-highest severity, should be used for problems that might cause unexpected behavior.                                     | WARNING  | YELLOW |
| INFO     | The fourth-highest severity, should be used for problems that are not necessarily problems, but might be interesting to the user. | INFO     | WHITE  |
| VERBOSE  | The second-lowest severity, should be used for when INFO is too noisy.                                                            |          | GRAY   |
| TRACE    | The lowest severity.                                                                                                              |          | GRAY   |

## Enum: `CODEACTIONKIND`

```sqf
// One of the following:
"GENERIC"
"QUICK_FIX"
"REFACTOR"
"EXTRACT_REFACTOR"
"INLINE_REFACTOR"
"REWRITE_REFACTOR"
"WHOLE_FILE"
```

The kind of [Array: `CODEACTION`](#array-codeaction). The kind groups the different code actions
into categories.

| Kind             | Description                                                                                                                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GENERIC          | A generic code action. Use only when the code action does not fit into any of the other categories.                           |
| QUICK_FIX        | A quick fix code action.                                                                                                      |
| REFACTOR         | A refactoring code action. Use only when the code action is a refactoring, but does not fit into any of the other categories. |
| EXTRACT_REFACTOR | Extracting modification of code to eg. extract a method out of a block of code.                                               |
| INLINE_REFACTOR  | Inline eg. a function call.                                                                                                   |
| REWRITE_REFACTOR | Modifications which change how something is written, eg. adding/removing parameters, rewriting array access to variables, ... |
| WHOLE_FILE       | Modifications span entire files.                                                                                              |
